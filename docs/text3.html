<p>A microcontroller is a small and low-cost microcomputer, which is designed to perform the specific tasks of embedded systems like displaying microwave’s information, receiving remote signals, etc.</p>
<p>The general microcontroller consists of the processor, the memory (RAM, ROM, EPROM), Serial ports, peripherals (timers, counters), etc.</p>
<p><b>Difference between Microprocessor (mp) and Microcontroller (uc)</b></p>
<p>The following table highlights the differences between a microprocessor and a microcontroller −</p>
<p>Microcontrollers are used to execute a single task within an application.</p>
<p>Microprocessors are used for big applications.</p>
<p>Other differenced – tell me which is the mp and which is the uc</p>
<p>designing and hardware cost is low.</p>
<p>designing and hardware cost is high.</p>
<p>Easy to replace.</p>
<p>Not so easy to replace.</p>
<p>It is built with CMOS technology, which requires less power to operate.</p>
<p>Its power consumption is high because it has to control the entire system.</p>
<p>It consists of CPU, RAM, ROM, I/O ports.</p>
<p>It doesn’t consist of RAM, ROM, I/O ports. It uses its pins to interface to peripheral devices.</p>
